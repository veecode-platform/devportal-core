## Plugin Sanity Check (cluster-free)

Validates that every plugin enabled by the catalog index loads in the real RHDH
backend (booted from `packages/backend` source). Populate `dynamic-plugins-root`
with the full index set, then run the dedicated Playwright config:

```bash
CATALOG_INDEX_IMAGE=quay.io/rhdh/plugin-catalog-index:next \
  ./local-harness/populate-catalog-index.sh
yarn e2e:plugin-sanity
```

The spec lives in `playwright/cluster-free/`, outside the `testDir` the cluster
projects scan, so it needs no per-project `testIgnore`. Put further
cluster-free-only specs there too.

CI runs it as the `plugin-sanity` job of the
[E2E Cluster-free workflow](../.github/workflows/e2e-cluster-free.yaml) — nightly
(`cron: 0 5 * * *`) and on `workflow_dispatch`, not on pull requests. A PR in
this repo cannot change the catalog index, so running the job as a PR check only
fails unrelated work when the index drifts. The runner has no registry
credentials: digest-pinned packages resolve anonymously (the install CLI rewrites
`registry.access.redhat.com/rhdh/` to `quay.io/rhdh/`). The few packages that are
not published publicly are listed in `local-harness/plugin-sanity-excludes.txt`.

The index is built outside this repo and changes on its own — it grew from 9 to
36 declared packages in the space of a week. For RC verification, run the
workflow manually and set the `catalog_index_image` input.

This complements, but does not depend on, the cluster-based `sanity-plugins`
deployment in the nightly OCP job: that one validates the curated plugin set on
the shipped image, while this validates the full index composition against the
current backend line, with no cluster and no product image.

Plugins that cannot initialize in a standalone backend are excluded in
`local-harness/plugin-sanity-excludes.txt`, which documents the rules and the
reason for each entry. When a plugin does abort the backend, the job pulls the
culprits onto the run summary via
`local-harness/filter-plugin-startup-failures.sh`.

## Local Test Runner

This directory contains scripts to run e2e tests locally against an OpenShift cluster.

### Prerequisites

Before running, ensure you have:

1. **Podman** installed and running with at least **8GB RAM** and **4 CPUs**
2. **oc CLI** installed and logged into your OpenShift cluster (`oc login`)
3. **Vault CLI** installed (for fetching secrets)
4. **jq** installed (for JSON parsing)
5. Access to the OpenShift CI vault (`https://vault.ci.openshift.org/ui/vault/secrets/kv/list/selfservice/rhdh-qe/`) - if you don't have access, reach out to @rhdh-qe in the team-rhdh channel.

#### Installing Prerequisites (macOS)

```bash
# Install tools via Homebrew
brew install podman jq rsync openshift-cli

# Install HashiCorp Vault (requires tap)
brew tap hashicorp/tap
brew install hashicorp/tap/vault

# Setup Podman machine (first time only)
podman machine init --memory 8192 --cpus 4
podman machine start
```

#### Installing Prerequisites (Linux)

Install `podman`, `oc`, `kubectl`, `vault`, `jq`, `rsync`, and `curl` using your distribution's package manager.

### Getting a Cluster

You need an OpenShift cluster to run e2e tests. Here are your options:

#### Option 1: Cluster Bot (Recommended)

Use the cluster-bot Slack app to request an ephemeral cluster. Send a direct message to the `cluster-bot` app:

```
launch 4.18 aws
```

The bot will provide login credentials once the cluster is ready (usually within a few minutes).

#### Option 2: rhdh-test-instance

You can use the [rhdh-test-instance](https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-test-instance) to get an ephemeral cluster.

> **⚠️ Warning:** This option is **not recommended for frequent testing** as it may interfere with existing PR test runs due to cluster claim conflicts. Use occasionally or for one-off testing only.

See the [rhdh-test-instance README](https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-test-instance/blob/main/README.md) for usage instructions.

#### Option 3: Bring Your Own Cluster

Use any OpenShift cluster you have access to. Simply login with `oc login` before running the local test runner.

### Scripts

| Script                | Description                                                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `local-run.sh`        | Main script - deploys RHDH to cluster and optionally runs tests |
| `container-init.sh`   | Runs inside the container (called by local-run.sh)              |
| `local-test-setup.sh` | Sets up environment for running tests locally in headed mode    |

### Quick Start

```bash
cd e2e-tests
./local-run.sh
```

Follow the interactive prompts to select:

1. **Run mode**: Deploy only (default, for headed debugging) or Deploy and run tests
2. **Job type**: OCP Helm PR tests, Nightly tests, Operator tests, etc.
3. **Image type**:
   - **Downstream** (`quay.io/rhdh/rhdh-hub-rhel9`): `next`, `latest`, or release-specific tag
   - **PR image** (`quay.io/rhdh-community/rhdh`): Enter PR number

After the container finishes, you're back on your host with the cluster still accessible.

### CLI Flags (Non-Interactive Mode)

For automation or quick runs, use CLI flags to skip interactive prompts:

```bash
# Test a PR image
./local-run.sh --pr 4023 --skip-tests

# Deploy downstream next image
./local-run.sh --repo rhdh/rhdh-hub-rhel9 --tag next --skip-tests

# Use a custom registry
./local-run.sh --registry registry.redhat.io --repo rhdh/rhdh-hub-rhel9 --tag latest --skip-tests

# Full flags
./local-run.sh -j pull-ci-redhat-developer-rhdh-main-e2e-ocp-helm -R registry.redhat.io -r rhdh/rhdh-hub-rhel9 -t next -s
```

| Flag               | Description                                                          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-j, --job`        | Job name                                                             |
| `-R, --registry`   | Image registry (default: `quay.io`)                                  |
| `-r, --repo`       | Image repository (e.g., `rhdh/rhdh-hub-rhel9`)                       |
| `-t, --tag`        | Image tag (e.g., `next`, `latest`, `1.5`)                            |
| `-p, --pr`         | PR number (sets repo to `rhdh-community/rhdh`, tag to `pr-<number>`) |
| `-s, --skip-tests` | Deploy only, skip running tests                                      |
| `-h, --help`       | Show help message                                                    |

### Running Tests Locally in Headed Mode (Recommended for Debugging)

> **This is the recommended approach for debugging tests** - you can see the browser UI, step through tests, and interact with the application.

#### Step 1: Deploy RHDH to the cluster

```bash
cd e2e-tests
./local-run.sh
# Select "Deploy only" (the default option)
```

The container will deploy RHDH and exit. You'll see next steps printed in the terminal.

#### Step 2: Setup environment

```bash
cd e2e-tests
source local-test-setup.sh # For Showcase tests
# or: source local-test-setup.sh rbac  # For RBAC tests
```

#### Step 3: Run tests with visible browser

```bash
yarn install
yarn playwright test --headed
```

#### Useful Playwright Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
yarn playwright test --headed

# Run a specific test file (use --project to specify which project)
yarn playwright test playwright/e2e/plugins/quick-access-and-tech-radar.spec.ts --headed --project=showcase

# Run RBAC tests (requires RBAC URL - use: source local-test-setup.sh rbac)
yarn playwright test playwright/e2e/plugins/rbac/rbac.spec.ts --headed --project=showcase-rbac

# Run tests matching a pattern (by test name)
yarn playwright test --headed -g "guest user"
yarn playwright test --headed -g "catalog"

# Run with trace for debugging
yarn playwright test --headed --trace on

# Run in UI mode (interactive debugging with time-travel)
yarn playwright test --ui

# View the last test report
npx playwright show-report .local-test/rhdh/.local-test/artifact_dir/showcase
```

> **Tip:** UI mode (`--ui`) opens an interactive browser where you can:
>
> - See all tests and run them individually
> - Watch tests execute in real-time
> - Step through test actions with time-travel debugging
> - Inspect DOM snapshots at each step
> - View console logs and network requests

---

### Test tags

Specs declare `@tag` markers via Playwright's native
[test tags](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-annotations#tag-tests) — the `tag`
option on `test` / `test.describe` (e.g.
`test.describe("Smoke test", { tag: "@smoke" }, () => { ... })`). This keeps the
tag out of the test title, so names stay stable for historical reporting while
Playwright's `--grep` / `--grep-invert` filters still select tests by tag,
letting CI or a local run target a subset.

| Tag                     | Meaning                                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@layer3-equivalent`    | A UI behavior in this spec also has a sibling Layer 3 component test (in `packages/app`). |
| `@smoke`                | Fast, high-signal check suitable to run on every PR.                                      |
| `@ga-plugin`            | Exercises a generally-available (GA) plugin.                                              |
| `@non-ga-plugin`        | Exercises a tech-preview / dev-preview (non-GA) plugin.                                   |
| `@blocked`              | Blocked by a known issue; tests are skipped with a Jira reference.                        |
| `@cluster-free-capable` | Validated to also run on the cluster-free harness.                                        |

`@cluster-free-capable` is what `playwright.legacy-local.config.ts` selects on. It
describes a capability of the test, not how a given run executed: the tag still shows
in reports of cluster runs, where the project name (e.g. `showcase-sanity-plugins`) is
what identifies the execution mode.

```bash
# Run only smoke-tagged tests
yarn playwright test --project=showcase --grep "@smoke"

# Run everything except specs that already have a Layer 3 equivalent
yarn playwright test --project=showcase --grep-invert "@layer3-equivalent"
```

In CI, set the `PLAYWRIGHT_GREP` environment variable (consumed by
`.ci/pipelines/lib/testing.sh`) to apply the same filter to a job, e.g.
`PLAYWRIGHT_GREP='@smoke'`.

> **Note:** `@layer3-equivalent` marks overlap with Layer 3 coverage; it does
> not remove the E2E spec. Whether to retire any duplicated E2E coverage is a
> separate decision tracked elsewhere.

### Configuration Options

#### Job Types

All job types are supported as long as you're logged into the target cluster (`oc login` or `kubectl login`).

| Option | JOB_NAME Pattern                        | Description                |
| ------ | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |

| 2      | `*ocp*helm*nightly*`                    | OCP Helm Nightly tests     |
| 3      | `*ocp*operator*nightly*`                | OCP Operator Nightly tests |
| 4      | `*ocp*helm*upgrade*nightly*`            | OCP Helm Upgrade tests     |
| 5      | `*ocp*operator*auth-providers*nightly*` | Auth Providers tests       |
| 6      | Custom                                  | Enter your own JOB_NAME    |

**Other supported patterns** (use Custom option):

- `*aks*helm*nightly*` / `*aks*operator*nightly*` - Azure AKS
- `*eks*helm*nightly*` / `*eks*operator*nightly*` - AWS EKS
- `*gke*helm*nightly*` / `*gke*operator*nightly*` - Google GKE
- `*osd-gcp*helm*nightly*` / `*osd-gcp*operator*nightly*` - OSD GCP

#### Image Repositories

| Option | Repository            | Description               |
| ------ | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1      | `rhdh-community/rhdh` | Community image (default) |
| 2      | `rhdh/rhdh-hub-rhel9` | Red Hat official image    |
| 3      | Custom                | Enter your own repository |

#### Image Tags

| Option | Tag           | Description                         |
| ------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1      | `next`        | Latest development build (default)  |
| 2      | `latest`      | Latest stable release               |
| 3      | `pr-<number>` | PR-specific build (e.g., `pr-4020`) |
| 4      | Custom        | Enter your own tag                  |

### Examples

#### Example 1: Test a PR image

Test changes from PR #4020 using the community image:

```bash
cd e2e-tests
./local-run.sh

# Select:
#   Job: 1 (OCP Helm PR tests)
#   Repo: 1 (rhdh-community/rhdh)
#   Tag: 3 (PR image) → Enter: 4020
#   Run: 1 (Deploy and run tests)
```

#### Example 2: Deploy only, debug tests locally

Deploy and then run specific tests in headed mode:

```bash
cd e2e-tests
./local-run.sh

# Select:
#   Job: 1 (OCP Helm PR tests)
#   Repo: 1 (rhdh-community/rhdh)
#   Tag: 1 (next)
#   Run: 2 (Deploy only)

# Keep container running, open new terminal:
cd e2e-tests
source local-test-setup.sh
yarn install
yarn playwright test --headed -g "guest user"
```

#### Example 3: Test Red Hat image with nightly job

Test the official Red Hat image:

```bash
cd e2e-tests
./local-run.sh

# Select:
#   Job: 2 (OCP Helm Nightly)
#   Repo: 2 (rhdh/rhdh-hub-rhel9)
#   Tag: 1 (next)
#   Run: 1 (Deploy and run tests)
```

#### Example 4: Test RBAC functionality locally

Deploy and run RBAC tests in headed mode:

```bash
cd e2e-tests
./local-run.sh
# Select: Deploy only

# New terminal:
cd e2e-tests
source local-test-setup.sh rbac # Use RBAC URL
yarn install
yarn playwright test --headed --project=showcase-rbac
```

#### Example 5: Test on AKS/EKS/GKE cluster

First login to your cluster, then run:

```bash
# Login to your cluster
az aks get-credentials --resource-group myRG --name myAKS
# or: aws eks update-kubeconfig --name myEKS
# or: gcloud container clusters get-credentials myGKE

cd e2e-tests
./local-run.sh

# Select:
#   Job: 6 (Custom) → Enter: periodic-ci-aks-helm-nightly
#   Repo: 1 (rhdh-community/rhdh)
#   Tag: 1 (next)
#   Run: 1 (Deploy and run tests)
```

#### Example 6: Run a single test file

```bash
cd e2e-tests
source local-test-setup.sh
yarn install
yarn playwright test playwright/e2e/plugins/quick-access-and-tech-radar.spec.ts --headed --project=showcase
```

#### Example 7: Run tests with trace for debugging

```bash
cd e2e-tests
source local-test-setup.sh
yarn install
yarn playwright test --headed --trace on -g "catalog"
```

#### Example 8: Interactive debugging with UI mode

```bash
cd e2e-tests
source local-test-setup.sh
yarn install
yarn playwright test --ui
```

This opens an interactive UI where you can select individual tests, watch them run in real-time, and step through actions with time-travel debugging.

### How It Works

1. **local-run.sh**:
   - Pulls the e2e-runner container image
   - Logs into Vault (OIDC) and gets secrets token
   - Creates a service account on the cluster with cluster-admin role
   - Copies repo to `e2e-tests/.local-test/rhdh` (keeps original clean)
   - Runs container with all credentials

2. **container-init.sh** (inside container):
   - Installs Vault CLI if needed
   - Fetches secrets from Vault and writes to `/tmp/secrets/`
   - Logs into OpenShift cluster
   - Sets up environment variables
   - Runs deployment via `openshift-ci-tests.sh`
   - If tests are skipped, outputs URLs and saves config

3. **local-test-setup.sh** (for headed tests):
   - Reads config from `e2e-tests/.local-test/rhdh/.local-test/config.env`
   - Exports secrets as environment variables (not stored on disk)
   - Gets fresh K8S_CLUSTER_TOKEN from cluster
   - Sets BASE_URL for Playwright

### Environment Variables

After running `local-test-setup.sh`, these variables are set:

| Variable                    | Description                                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BASE_URL`                  | URL of the deployed RHDH instance (Playwright uses this as the test base URL)                  |
| `SHOWCASE_URL`              | Legacy name for the standard RHDH deployment URL (same value as `BASE_URL` for showcase tests) |
| `SHOWCASE_RBAC_URL`         | Legacy name for the RBAC deployment URL                                                        |
| `K8S_CLUSTER_URL`           | OpenShift API server URL                                                                       |
| `K8S_CLUSTER_TOKEN`         | Service account token (48-hour duration)                                                       |
| `JOB_NAME`                  | Selected job name                                                                              |
| `IMAGE_REGISTRY`            | Image registry (default: `quay.io`)                                                            |
| `IMAGE_REPO`                | Image repository (fallback: `QUAY_REPO`)                                                       |
| `TAG_NAME`                  | Image tag                                                                                      |
| Plus all secrets from Vault | (exported with `-`, `.`, `/` replaced by `_`)                                                  |

> **Note:** `BASE_URL` is the canonical Playwright base URL for the RHDH instance under test.
> `SHOWCASE_URL` and `SHOWCASE_RBAC_URL` are legacy names retained by `local-test-setup.sh` and
> deployment scripts; `local-test-setup.sh` sets `BASE_URL` from the appropriate legacy URL.
> Yarn scripts such as `yarn showcase`, `yarn showcase-rbac`, and `yarn test:stability` still use
> the `showcase` Playwright project name for historical reasons.

### Artifacts and Logs

Test artifacts are saved to `e2e-tests/.local-test/rhdh/.local-test/`:

- `artifact_dir/` - Test artifacts, screenshots, traces
- `shared_dir/` - Shared data between test runs
- `config.env` - Configuration for local-test-setup.sh

### Troubleshooting

#### Error: Script failed

The container will drop into an interactive shell for debugging. Check logs, run commands, and investigate.

#### Error: Config file not found

Run `./local-run.sh` first with "Deploy only" option to create the config.

#### Error: Not logged into OpenShift

Run `oc login` before running local-test-setup.sh.

#### Error: Image does not exist

The script verifies the image exists on quay.io before proceeding (verification is skipped for non-quay registries). For PR images, ensure the PR build has completed.

### Security Notes

- Secrets are fetched from Vault and exported as environment variables at runtime (not stored in files locally)
- K8S_CLUSTER_TOKEN is generated fresh each time (not stored)
- The repo is copied to `e2e-tests/.local-test/rhdh` so the original stays clean
- Service account tokens have a 48-hour duration

## Triggering Nightly CI Jobs

The script at `.ci/pipelines/trigger-nightly-job.sh` triggers RHDH nightly ProwJobs via the OpenShift CI Gangway REST API.

### Prerequisites

- `oc` CLI installed
- `curl` and `jq` installed
- Access to the OpenShift CI cluster (SSO login via browser)

### Usage

```bash
# Basic trigger (default image):
.ci/pipelines/trigger-nightly-job.sh --job periodic-ci-redhat-developer-rhdh-main-e2e-ocp-helm-nightly

# Trigger with a specific image:
.ci/pipelines/trigger-nightly-job.sh \
  --job periodic-ci-redhat-developer-rhdh-main-e2e-ocp-helm-nightly \
  --image-registry registry.redhat.io \
  --image-repo rhdh/rhdh-hub-rhel9 \
  --tag 1.9-123

# Dry-run (print the curl command without executing):
.ci/pipelines/trigger-nightly-job.sh \
  --job periodic-ci-redhat-developer-rhdh-main-e2e-ocp-helm-nightly \
  --dry-run
```

### Flags

| Flag                   | Description                                           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `-j, --job`            | **(required)** Full ProwJob name to trigger           |
| `-I, --image-registry` | Override the image registry (default: `quay.io`)      |
| `-q, --image-repo`     | Override the image repository (requires `--tag`)      |
| `-t, --tag`            | Override the image tag                                |
| `-o, --org`            | Override the GitHub org (default: `redhat-developer`) |
| `-r, --repo`           | Override the GitHub repo name (default: `rhdh`)       |
| `-b, --branch`         | Override the branch name                              |
| `-S, --send-alerts`    | Send Slack alerts (default: alerts are skipped)       |
| `-n, --dry-run`        | Print the curl command without executing              |

### Authentication

The script uses a dedicated kubeconfig (`~/.config/openshift-ci/kubeconfig`) to avoid interfering with the current cluster context. If not logged in or the token is expired, it opens a browser for SSO login.

### AI-Assisted Triggering

A Claude Code command is available at `.claude/commands/trigger-nightly-job.md` that provides an interactive, AI-guided workflow for triggering nightly jobs. It:

- Fetches available jobs from Prow and presents them in a table
- Maps natural language descriptions to job names (e.g., "ocp helm" or "azure operator")
- Checks for shared cluster constraints (GKE and OSD-GCP jobs share clusters)
- Fetches available image tags from Quay when needed
- Builds the command and asks for confirmation before executing

To use it, run the `/trigger-nightly-job` command in Claude Code or OpenCode.

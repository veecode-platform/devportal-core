# RHDH Plugin Quality Requirements by Support Level

**Epic**: RHIDP-13497 — Plugin Testing by Support Level  
**Author**: Gustavo Lira e Silva  
**Date**: 2026-06-17 (updated 2026-08-04)  
**Status**: PROPOSED (pending team review)

## Document Governance

- **Canonical location**: This document in the `rhdh` repository (`docs/testing-requirements-matrix.md`)
- **Owner**: Quality Engineering
- **Review cadence**: Each major RHDH release
- **Change process**: PR to this repository, reviewed by Quality team
- **Referenced from**: RHDH Plugin Ecosystem Workflow — row 5.0 (Quality)
- **Jira epic**: [RHIDP-13497](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHIDP-13497)

## Executive Summary

This document defines differentiated testing requirements for RHDH plugins based on their support level. GA plugins receive full test coverage across all layers; Tech-Preview gets selective coverage; Community gets load/sanity checks only.

**Key principle**: Testing rigor scales with support commitment.

## Support Level Definitions

| Level | Description | Commitment | Workspaces |
|-------|-------------|------------|------------|
| **Generally Available (GA)** | Production-ready, fully supported by Red Hat | Full support, SLA-backed | 17 |
| **Tech Preview (TP)** | Beta quality, not production-ready | Limited support, no SLA | 8 |
| **Community** | Community-maintained | No Red Hat support | 41 |
| **Dev Preview** | Experimental, under active development | No support, may change | 5 |

**Total**: 64 distinct workspaces across 4 support levels (some workspaces contain packages at multiple support levels, so the column above sums higher).

**Source of truth**: Support levels are defined in `rhdh-plugin-export-overlays/workspaces/*/metadata/*.yaml` (`spec.support` field).

## Test Layer Definitions

| Layer | Type | Scope | Tools | Execution Time |
|-------|------|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Layer 1** | Unit Tests | Individual functions, pure logic | Jest, supertest, `mockServices` | Seconds |
| **Layer 2** | Integration Tests | Plugin wiring, DB, service-to-service | Jest + `startTestBackend` | Seconds to minutes |
| **Layer 3** | Component Tests | React components, user interactions | RTL, `@backstage/frontend-test-utils`, jsdom | Minutes |
| **Layer 4a** | Plugin E2E | Real browser against a local Backstage instance — no cluster | Playwright (local `webServer`) | Minutes |
| **Layer 4b** | Platform E2E | Full system on a deployed instance | Playwright, K8s/OCP | Minutes to hours |

`startTestBackend` belongs to Layer 2, not Layer 3 — it starts a real Backstage backend
in-process with in-memory SQLite. Layer 3 renders React with a mocked Backstage context and
never starts a backend.

Layer 4 is split because not every browser test needs a cluster. Where the requirement tables
below say "E2E", **Layer 4a is the default**; Layer 4b applies only when the test genuinely
requires real infrastructure (OAuth providers, Kubernetes API, external databases, operators),
and that rationale must be documented on the test.

Jest is the test runner for Layers 1-3. A Vitest migration was evaluated and deferred under
RHIDP-13504, pending Backstage upstream completing its own migration.

Layer 4a's mechanism is Playwright's own `webServer` field. There is no Backstage utility that
boots an instance for a browser test: `@backstage/e2e-test-utils@0.1.2` exports two functions
from its `/playwright` entry point — `generateProjects()`, which returns one Playwright project
per monorepo package containing an `e2e-tests` directory, and `failOnBrowserErrors()`. It starts
nothing. This is recorded because the parent Test Strategy previously described that package as
enabling local runs; that text was corrected on 2026-08-18.

---

## Layer 3 and the new frontend system

RHDH is migrating to the new frontend system (NFS), where a plugin contributes through
extensions built with `Blueprint.make(...)` rather than through the legacy Scalprum
`mountPoints` configuration. That changes what Layer 3 has to cover, and introduces a coverage
gap this matrix did not previously name.

**The gap** (measured 2026-08-18 across the 22 plugins that have an e2e suite in
`rhdh-plugin-export-overlays`, by checking each plugin's upstream tree for an `src/alpha*`
surface and for a `createExtensionTester` test of it):

| State | Plugins |
|---|---|
| NFS surface exists, and a test covers it | **3** — `github` (7 tests), `tech-radar` (1), `scorecard` (1) |
| NFS surface exists, nothing tests it | **16** |
| No NFS surface upstream yet | 3 (two are backend-only, so none is due) |

**Why it matters more than the count suggests.** Under NFS a plugin that fails to contribute
produces a clean boot with nothing on the page — no error, no console warning, exit 0. A test
that only asserts the app loaded passes against a plugin that contributed nothing. Verifying
this at Layer 4b means the failure arrives as `heading "X" not found` after a full deploy, in a
different repository from the code that broke.

**Requirement.** For any plugin declaring an NFS surface, Layer 3 coverage should include at
least one test that the extension attaches and declares the outputs the app reads. This is
`createExtensionTester` from `@backstage/frontend-test-utils`, and it needs that package as a
devDependency — several plugins carry only `@backstage/test-utils`, which does not export it.

Three assertions cover the failure modes, all verified by mutation against
`community-plugins/workspaces/acr` on 2026-08-18:

| Assertion | Mutation that proves it |
|---|---|
| `tester.get(EntityContentBlueprint.dataRefs.title)` | changing the declared tab title is caught |
| `tester.get(coreExtensionData.routePath)` | changing the route path is caught |
| the plugin's `extensions[]` contains the extension id | removing it from the plugin is caught |

The third is not optional. `createExtensionTester` instantiates an extension **in isolation**,
so it cannot see whether the plugin registers it — removing the extension from the plugin's
`extensions` array leaves the first two assertions green. Assert the plugin's own composition
separately, and assert `$$type` is `@backstage/FrontendPlugin`, which is what the frontend
loader dispatches on at runtime.

Note also that `apis` must be passed to `renderInTestApp`, not to `createExtensionTester`, when
the tester's element is nested inside it; the tester's own `apis` option is ignored in that
composition and the render fails with `NotImplementedError: No implementation available for
apiRef{...}`.

---

## Layer 4a already exists, and overlaps Layer 4b

Recorded because the rule above — *"where the tables say E2E, Layer 4a is the default"* — reads
as aspirational, and it is not. Measured 2026-08-18 for 10 of the 11 `rhdh-plugins` workspaces
that also carry an e2e suite in `rhdh-plugin-export-overlays` — the eleventh, `app-defaults`,
has no upstream lane, which is why it is absent from the table:

| Workspace | Layer 4a in plugin repo (no cluster) | Layer 4b in overlays (cluster) | Identical test names |
|---|---|---|---|
| `intelligent-assistant` | 92 | 34 | 7 |
| `scorecard` | 47 | 16 | 0 |
| `homepage` | 16 | 18 | 1 |
| `extensions` | 12 | 11 | 5 |
| `orchestrator` | 11 | 26 | 0 |
| `adoption-insights` | 10 | 7 | 1 |
| `global-header` | 8 | 10 | 0 |
| `bulk-import` | 6 | 9 | 0 |
| `theme` | 4 | 5 | 1 |
| `quickstart` | 3 | 2 | 2 (all) |
| **Total** | **209** | **138** | **17** |

Both test columns count statically declared `test()` blocks, so the two sides are comparable
to each other but are a floor rather than a run count: Playwright expands parametrised tests
at collection time, and `npx playwright test --list` reports 19 for `scorecard` against the
16 declared and 32 for `orchestrator` against 26.

Each of those 10 has a `playwright.config.ts` with a `webServer` block starting a
local instance on ports 3000-3002, `testDir: 'e2e-tests'`, and specs named `*.test.ts`. None of
those directories references `RHDHDeployment`, `oc`, `kubectl`, `helm` or `INSTALLATION_METHOD`,
so the lane is genuinely cluster-free. `homepage` already parameterises legacy versus NFS in it
through an `appMode` variable. Six of the 11 `community-plugins` workspaces in the same set have
an equivalent lane, and `acr`, `github` and `tech-radar` ship a local `packages/app-next` host.

`quickstart` is the clearest case: upstream has `test.describe('Test Quick Start plugin')` with
`test('Access Quick start as Guest or Admin')` and `test('Access Quick start as User')`; the
overlay suite carries the same describe block and the same two test names.

**These counts are tests that exist. Swept 2026-08-18 over the last 300 CI runs, 8 of the 10
lanes are green** — `global-header` 1m34s, `theme` 1m28s, `homepage` 2m24s, `quickstart` 2m52s,
`extensions` 4m44s, `bulk-import` 4m47s, `scorecard` 13m30s, `intelligent-assistant` 25m35s.

Two are not. `orchestrator` is **persistently red**, not an outlier: three consecutive runs failed
after 195m, 216m and 191m against the job timeout, so it consumes roughly 3.5 hours of runner time
per run and never reports a real result. `adoption-insights` has **no signal** — no PR touched it
in the window.

That last one is a property of the gate rather than the lane, and it matters when reading any of
these numbers: the CI matrix runs only workspaces a PR changed, so "green" means green the last
time that workspace changed, not green today.

**This document does not decide what to do about it.** Exact-name matching is a floor, not the
real overlap — a reworded test will not match — and only the person who owns the plugin and its
tests can say whether a given 4b test still earns its cluster:

- It may be redundant, and removing it reclaims a namespace.
- It may look redundant but assert something the local lane cannot: a ConfigMap mount, a real
  operator, an OCI-published artifact rather than workspace source, or the dynamic-plugin
  loading path itself. That last one is the substantive difference — the overlay lane exercises
  the *published artifact*, while the upstream lane exercises *workspace source*. A pair of
  tests with the same name can therefore be testing genuinely different things.
- It may be worth keeping while 4a coverage is still being established.

What this matrix does ask is that the choice be **made and recorded**, per the rule above: a 4b
test should carry its rationale. Where that rationale turns out to be "the upstream lane already
covers this", the owner decides whether the 4b copy goes.

## Testing Requirements Matrix

### GA (Generally Available) — FULL COVERAGE

| Requirement | Minimum | Target | Enforcement |
|-------------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Layer 1 (Unit)** | 60% coverage | 80% coverage | Required for release |
| **Layer 2 (Integration)** | 40% coverage | 60% coverage | Required for release |
| **Layer 3 (Component)** | Critical paths | All user flows | Recommended |
| **Layer 4 (E2E)** | Smoke tests | Critical user journeys | Required for release |
| **Code review** | 2 approvals | — | Required |
| **Security scan** | No high/critical CVEs | — | Blocks release |
| **Performance** | No regressions | — | Monitored |

**Threshold precedence**: the percentages above are per support level, measured through
Codecov `components`/`flags`. They are independent of the repository-wide floors defined in
Section 5 of the Test Strategy Proposal. Where the two differ, the support-level value applies.

**Quality gates**:
- PR cannot merge without passing Layer 1-2 tests
- Release cannot ship without E2E smoke tests passing
- Coverage drop > 5% triggers review

**Current state** (verified 2026-07-24 against overlay repo metadata):
- 14/17 GA workspaces have E2E tests (82%)
- GA gaps: `apiconnect`, `dynatrace-dql`, `scaffolder-backend-module-regex`
- All 5 RHDH-owned GA workspaces have both E2E and unit tests
- Codecov components configured with support-level grouping

#### GA Workspace E2E Coverage Detail

| GA Workspace | E2E | Smoke | Unit Tests (rhdh-plugins) | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| adoption-insights | Yes | — | 53 files | RHDH Eng |
| analytics | Yes | Yes | upstream | upstream |
| apiconnect | **No** | Yes | upstream | upstream |
| backstage | Yes | Yes | upstream | upstream |
| dynatrace-dql | **No** | Yes | upstream | upstream |
| global-header | Yes | — | 27 files | RHDH Eng |
| homepage | Yes | — | 26 files | RHDH Eng |
| keycloak | Yes | Yes | upstream | upstream |
| lightspeed | Yes | Yes | upstream | upstream |
| orchestrator | Yes | Yes | 105 files | RHDH Eng |
| quickstart | Yes | — | 17 files | RHDH Eng |
| rbac | Yes | — | upstream | upstream |
| roadie-backstage-plugins | Yes | Yes | upstream | upstream |
| scaffolder-backend-module-kubernetes | Yes | — | upstream | upstream |
| scaffolder-backend-module-regex | **No** | **No** | upstream | upstream |
| tech-radar | Yes | Yes | upstream | upstream |
| topology | Yes | — | upstream | upstream |

**Summary**: 14/17 GA workspaces have E2E tests (82%). 3 gaps remain, all upstream/3rd-party owned.

---

### Tech Preview — SELECTIVE COVERAGE

| Requirement | Minimum | Target | Enforcement |
|-------------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Layer 1 (Unit)** | 40% coverage | 60% coverage | Recommended |
| **Layer 2 (Integration)** | 20% coverage | 40% coverage | Recommended |
| **Layer 3 (Component)** | Critical paths only | — | Optional |
| **Layer 4 (E2E)** | Smoke tests | Critical paths | Recommended |
| **Code review** | 1 approval | — | Required |
| **Security scan** | No critical CVEs | — | Blocks release |
| **Performance** | — | — | Not monitored |

**Quality gates**:
- PR requires passing tests (if tests exist)
- No coverage drop enforcement
- E2E tests recommended but not blocking
- Must meet GA requirements before promotion to GA

**Decision (Q1)**: Coverage requirements are enforced only when promoting TP to GA. TP plugins are not blocked on coverage during their TP lifecycle, but must meet GA requirements before promotion. This avoids premature enforcement on experimental work.

**Current state** (verified 2026-08-04):
- 5/8 TP workspaces have E2E tests (63%)
- 4/8 have smoke tests
- TP gaps: `cost-management` (smoke only), `pingidentity` (smoke only), `scaffolder-relation-processor` (no tests)

---

### Community — SANITY & LOAD CHECKS

| Requirement | Minimum | Target | Enforcement |
|-------------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Layer 1 (Unit)** | — | Any coverage is good | Not required |
| **Layer 2 (Integration)** | — | — | Not required |
| **Layer 3 (Component)** | — | — | Not required |
| **Layer 4 (E2E)** | — | — | Not required |
| **Load test** | Published artifact installs and boots | — | Required |
| **Config validation** | appConfigExamples are valid | — | Required |
| **Security scan** | No critical CVEs in dependencies | — | Warning only |
| **Code review** | — | — | Not required |

**Quality gates**:
- The published artifact must install and boot
- Configuration examples must not crash the app
- No blocking requirements on test coverage

**Decision (Q2)**: All Community plugins must pass a load test. This is already partially implemented: 22/41 community workspaces have smoke tests in the overlay repo.

> **Wording note (2026-08-04)**: this requirement previously read "plugin loads without error in a
> default RHDH instance". That phrasing no longer maps to this tier — community plugins were
> removed from `default.packages.yaml` under RHIDP-13262 (2.1.0) to enable multi-arch builds, so
> there is no default RHDH instance containing them. They exist only as artifacts published by
> `rhdh-plugin-export-overlays` to ghcr. The operative definition is now **"the published artifact
> installs and boots"**, verified off-cluster and without Docker by the overlays
> `smoke-tests-native/` harness.

**Current state** (verified 2026-08-04):
- 10/41 Community workspaces have E2E tests (24%)
- 22/41 Community workspaces have smoke tests (54%)
- 15/41 Community workspaces have neither E2E nor smoke tests

Against the 2026-07-24 snapshot (40 workspaces / 22 smoke / 9 E2E / 14 neither) coverage is
**static**: one workspace was added and arrived uncovered, one existing workspace gained E2E.
Hand-written per-workspace coverage does not close this gap on its own, which is the rationale
for the metadata-driven sweep tracked in RHIDP-13510.

**Scope of the load test** (RHIDP-13510): all 107 community packages get OCI install validation;
49 of 53 backend packages get a real boot via `startTestBackend`; 4 catalog-extending backend
modules are install-only (the catalog core does not boot standalone) and stay on the Docker smoke;
the 54 frontend packages get bundle-layout validation only. Frontend **rendering** is deferred to
RHIDP-16009, blocked on the new frontend system (RHIDP-15082 / RHIDP-15379).

Since 2026-08-18 that bundle validation is no longer a presence check: overlays PR #3282
validates the module-federation remote against the guards the backend's remotes router actually
applies, and reports whether the artifact exposes the NFS entry points it declares. A manifest
missing a field the router needs makes the router log and skip it, so
`GET /.backstage/dynamic-features/remotes` still answers `200 []` and the app boots with no
plugins and no error — which is why presence was not enough. Of 44 published frontend artifacts,
35 are servable with an NFS entry point and 9 are servable without one.

### Dev Preview — EXPERIMENTAL (NO REQUIREMENTS)

| Requirement | Minimum | Target | Enforcement |
|-------------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **All test layers** | — | — | Not required |
| **Load test** | — | — | Not required |
| **Code review** | — | — | Not required |
| **Security scan** | — | — | Not required |

**Quality gates**: None. Experimental quality, may break.

**Current state** (verified 2026-08-04):
- 2/5 Dev-Preview workspaces have E2E tests (40%)
- 3/5 have smoke tests

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Baseline & Documentation (Current)

**Goal**: Document current state and establish requirements.

**Tasks**:
1. Define testing matrix (this document)
2. GA plugin E2E coverage gap analysis (completed 2026-07-24: 3 gaps identified)
3. Enhance sanity checks for all enabled plugins
4. Validate plugin appConfigExamples against schemas (overlay repo)

---

### Phase 2: Enforcement for GA

**Goal**: Enforce Layer 1-2 coverage requirements for GA plugins.

**Tasks**:
1. Add Codecov coverage gates for GA plugins
2. Create E2E tests for remaining 3 GA plugins without E2E (upstream-owned)
3. Configure branch protection to require tests

**Depends on**: RHIDP-13233 (Add Layer 1-2 tests for RHDH-owned plugins)

---

### Phase 3: Community Plugin Quality

**Goal**: Implement load/sanity checks for Community plugins.

**Tasks**:
1. Implement Community plugin load-test suite — RHIDP-13510, open. Metadata-driven sweep over
   every `spec.support: community` package, run through the overlays `smoke-tests-native/`
   harness (no cluster, no Docker). Frontend rendering split out to RHIDP-16009.
2. Add appConfigExamples schema validation — done (RHIDP-13509, RHIDP-15902, RHIDP-15903)
3. Define quality expectations for community plugins — done (RHIDP-13512)

---

## Exception Process

### When Can Requirements Be Waived?

**GA plugins**:
- **Technical blocker**: External dependency prevents testing — document in Jira
- **Timeline**: Release deadline conflict — requires PM approval + technical debt ticket
- **Coverage drop**: Legacy code deletion lowers % — allowed if absolute coverage increases

**Tech Preview plugins**:
- **Promotion path**: TP to GA requires meeting GA requirements first
- **Exception**: Can ship with lower coverage if documented

**Community plugins**: No exceptions needed (already minimal requirements).

### Approval Process

1. Engineer files exception request in Jira
2. Tech lead reviews technical justification
3. PM approves timeline/priority trade-off
4. Exception logged with expiry date
5. Follow-up ticket created for remediation

## Getting a Plugin Listed in the Extensions Catalog

> **Status**: like the section that follows it, this is a Quality Engineering expectation, not
> agreed policy, and it creates no obligation for any plugin owner today.

This matrix is keyed on the **declared support level**, not on who owns the plugin. A team that
declares GA takes on the GA row — whether that team sits in RHDH Engineering, elsewhere in Red
Hat, or outside it entirely. The requirements do not soften because the owner is external.

What does change for an external owner is **where the evidence comes from**: they do not build
on RHDH CI, so several requirements cannot be observed the way they are for an RHDH-owned
workspace. This section says which ones we can still measure ourselves and which ones fall back
to the owner's own word.

### Two gates, neither substituting the other

Getting listed already passes a **product gate** owned by Product Management. Nothing here adds
to it — this section only names the **quality gate** that sits beside it.

| Gate | Owner | Decides | Documented in |
|------|-------|---------|---------------|
| Product | Product Management | Whether the plugin is listed at all, and in which catalog tier | overlays `user-guide/03-plugin-owner-responsibilities.md` §1 — an RHDHPLAN feature, plus entries in `rhdh-supported-packages.txt` (Supported Plugins: GA/TP), `rhdh-community-packages.txt` (curated Optional Extras: Community/Dev-Preview), and `default.packages.yaml` (GA only) |
| Quality | Quality Engineering | Whether the plugin meets the requirements of the level it declares | The support-level tables in this document |

Clearing the product gate without the quality gate produces a listing whose support badge
overstates what was verified. Clearing the quality gate without the product gate simply means
the plugin is not listed. Both are needed, and neither implies the other.

### What counts as evidence

The overlays pipeline validates every listed plugin, external ones included. That is where most
of the evidence already comes from — no new infrastructure is proposed here.

| Requirement | Evidence | Produced by |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| OCI artifact builds and publishes | Automated | `export-workspaces-as-dynamic.yaml`, `publish-workspace-plugins.yaml` |
| Published artifact installs and boots | Automated | `native-smoke.yaml`, `community-plugin-sweep.yaml`, `run-workspace-smoke-tests.yaml` |
| `appConfigExamples` valid against the plugin's config schema | Automated | `validate-app-config-examples.yaml` |
| Compatible with the target Backstage version | Automated | `check-backstage-compatibility.yaml` |
| Layer 4 (E2E) | Automated **if** the workspace has `e2e-tests/` | `workspace-tests.yaml`, Prow |
| Layer 1-2 coverage | Automated **if** the workspace has `e2e-tests/` and `coverage-anchors/`; otherwise a public coverage link declared by the owner | `refresh-coverage-snapshot.yaml` → Codecov |
| Security scan, code review approvals | Self-declared — both run in the owner's own repository | — |

The dividing line is the workspace, not the organisation. **Adding `e2e-tests/` and
`coverage-anchors/` to the overlay workspace is what converts a self-declared number into a
measured one**, and it is available to an external owner on exactly the same terms as an
internal one. It is not a requirement; it is the cheap way to stop having to be taken at your
word.

`coverage-anchors/` are empty files generated by `./scripts/generate-coverage-anchors.sh
<workspace>` in the overlays repo — see that repo's `README.md` for why they exist.

### What each level asks of an external owner

The rows below point at the tables above rather than repeating their numbers, which would drift.

| Declared level | Quality gate | What it means in practice |
|----------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **GA** | [GA row](#ga-generally-available--full-coverage), in full | The heaviest ask: Layer 1-2 coverage floors, E2E smoke as a release blocker, blocking security scan, 2 approvals |
| **Tech Preview** | [TP row](#tech-preview--selective-coverage) | Coverage is recommended rather than enforced during the TP lifecycle, but the full GA row must be met **before** promotion to GA |
| **Community** | [Community row](#community--sanity--load-checks) | Two `Required` items only — the published artifact installs and boots, and `appConfigExamples` are valid. Both are already automated, so listing at this level asks nothing of the owner beyond a working artifact |
| **Dev Preview** | [Dev-Preview row](#dev-preview--experimental-no-requirements) | Nothing required |

### Worked example: `cost-management` from TP to GA

Verified in `rhdh-plugin-export-overlays` on 2026-08-06. `cost-management` is owned outside RHDH
Engineering and is a fair illustration of the gap between "listed" and "listed as GA".

**Current state**:

- `spec.support: tech-preview` on both packages (`workspaces/cost-management/metadata/`)
- `spec.support.level: tech-preview` on the Plugin entity
  (`catalog-entities/extensions/plugins/cost-management.yaml`)
- the workspace has `smoke-tests/`, and no `e2e-tests/` or `coverage-anchors/`
- it appears in none of `rhdh-supported-packages.txt`, `rhdh-community-packages.txt` or
  `default.packages.yaml` — it is a catalog entry only

**To be listed as GA**, both gates apply:

*Product gate* — an RHDHPLAN feature approved by PM; the packages added to
`rhdh-supported-packages.txt` and to `default.packages.yaml`; `spec.support` and
`spec.support.level` moved to `generally-available` in both the workspace metadata and the
Plugin entity.

*Quality gate* — the GA row in full: Layer 1 ≥60%, Layer 2 ≥40%, E2E smoke tests required for
release, no high or critical CVEs, 2 review approvals.

*Evidence* — the artifact already installs and boots via the smoke tests, and its
`appConfigExamples` are already validated. The coverage and E2E rows are the gap: today they
would be self-declared, because the workspace carries neither `e2e-tests/` nor
`coverage-anchors/`. Adding both is what would make the GA claim measurable rather than
asserted.

Nothing above is specific to this plugin being externally owned — an RHDH-owned workspace at TP
with the same shape would face the same list.

### Staying listed

A support level is a claim about the present, so it is re-checked rather than granted once. The
signals below are the ones the pipeline already produces; each escalates to the plugin owner
first, consistent with the `Escalated to the plugin owner before release` outcome in the
Compliance table below.

| Signal | Source |
|--------|--------|
| The published artifact stops installing or booting across consecutive runs | Community plugin sweep / smoke tests |
| The workspace is reported incompatible with the target Backstage version | [Backstage Compatibility Report](https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-plugin-export-overlays/wiki/Backstage-Compatibility-Report) |
| Critical CVEs remain unresolved | Dependency scanning in the owner's repository |
| Upstream is no longer maintained | Owner or Product Management |

The downgrade and removal procedure itself is **not** defined here — it already exists in the
overlays repo under `user-guide/03-plugin-owner-responsibilities.md`, *Handling Plugin
Deprecation*, including the customer notice windows per level (GA: 2 full y-stream releases;
Tech Preview: 1 recommended; Dev Preview and Community: no SLA).

### What this section is not

It is not a certification programme. Formal partner certification is tracked separately in
RHDHPLAN-19, built with the Red Hat Partner Ecosystem team, and the `Certified` release status
shown in the Extensions Catalog comes from RHDHPLAN-717 — neither is granted or withheld by
anything in this document. This section covers testing requirements only.

---

## Compliance Verification (proposal — not yet agreed)

> **Status**: this section is a proposal from Quality Engineering. It is not agreed policy and
> creates no obligation for any plugin owner today. Adopting it requires sign-off through the
> RHDH Plugin Ecosystem RACI — in particular from Productization, Security and Product
> Management, and explicitly so for 3rd-party plugins, whose owners are outside RHDH
> Engineering and cannot be bound by a decision taken in this repository alone.

Requirements without a named verifier become self-attestation. The table below proposes who
would check what, against which artifact, and at which milestone, as a starting point for that
discussion.

| Milestone | What would be verified | Artifact | Proposed verifier | Proposed outcome if it fails |
|-----------|------------------------|----------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| PR merge | Layer 1-2 pass; coverage delta | Codecov PR check | Automated (`codecov.yml`) | PR blocked (GA only) |
| Feature freeze | Support-level thresholds met | Codecov component report per workspace | Quality | Plugin ships at the next lower support level |
| TP to GA promotion | Full GA row of this matrix | Compliance report (below) | Quality | Promotion deferred pending remediation |
| Every release | The published artifact installs and boots | Overlay load-test / smoke result | Quality | Escalated to the plugin owner before release |

**Compliance report**: would be generated per release from Codecov component data plus the
overlay load-test results, and shared with plugin owners at feature freeze so gaps are visible
early rather than at release time.

**Open questions for the RACI discussion**:

- Should verification outcomes be advisory or blocking, and blocking at which milestone?
- Who arbitrates a disputed result — Quality, Product Management, or the release lead?

These are deliberately left open. Answering them is the point of the discussion, not a
precondition for it.

A third question — *what evidence is acceptable from 3rd-party plugin owners who do not build on
RHDH CI?* — was open here until the [What counts as
evidence](#what-counts-as-evidence) table above answered it: whatever the overlays pipeline
already measures counts as evidence for any owner, and the remainder is self-declared until the
workspace carries `e2e-tests/` and `coverage-anchors/`.

## Quality Metrics Dashboard

### What We Track

**Per support level**:
- Test coverage % (Layer 1, 2, 3 combined)
- E2E test coverage (% of workspaces with E2E)
- Test execution time
- Flaky test rate
- CVE count by severity

**Current baselines** (measured 2026-08-04):

| Level | E2E Coverage | Smoke Coverage | Unit Tests (rhdh-plugins) |
|-------|-------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| **GA** | 14/17 (82%) | 9/17 (53%) | 5/5 RHDH-owned workspaces |
| **TP** | 5/8 (63%) | 4/8 (50%) | 3 workspaces |
| **Community** | 10/41 (24%) | 22/41 (54%) | 3 workspaces |
| **Dev-Preview** | 2/5 (40%) | 3/5 (60%) | 5 workspaces |

Across the overlays repo as a whole: 24 of 64 workspaces have `e2e-tests/` and 33 have
`smoke-tests/`. Unit-test columns were not re-measured on 2026-08-04 and carry the
2026-07-24 values.

**Dashboard**: [Codecov rhdh-plugins](https://app.codecov.io/gh/redhat-developer/rhdh-plugins)  
**Components configured**: GA Plugins, Tech-Preview Plugins, Community Plugins, Dev-Preview Plugins

## Frontend vs Backend Testing (Q3)

**Decision**: Same requirements for frontend and backend initially. Reassess after Phase 1 data collection shows whether differentiation is needed.

**Rationale**: Applying uniform requirements simplifies communication and enforcement. If data reveals that frontend plugins consistently achieve coverage through Layer 3 component tests while backend plugins rely on Layer 2 integration tests, we can refine the matrix.

## Recent Progress (as of 2026-07-24)

### Coverage Infrastructure (delivered)
- Codecov configured across all 3 repos (rhdh, rhdh-plugins, overlays)
- Per-workspace flags with support-level component grouping (rhdh-plugins)
- E2E coverage collection via V8/Playwright (rhdh PR #4798)
- Coverage snapshots for 5 workspaces in overlay repo
- All coverage checks set to `informational` (never blocks PRs)

### Test Layers (delivered)
- Layer 1+2 backend tests: rhdh PR #4863
- Layer 3 component tests: rhdh PR #4864
- Layer 1-3 writing guide: rhdh PR #5140 (docs/testing.md)
- Cluster-free E2E harness (L4a): rhdh PR #5005, expanded in #5057 (14 test cases)
- Native smoke harness (no Docker): overlays PR #2714, #2731

### Active Test Expansion
- Orchestrator: 6 test PRs merged in July 2026 (RHIDP-15513) — 105 test files
- Plugin sanity cluster-free check: rhdh PR #4967 (merged 2026-08-04) — sweeps the
  29-package catalog index (`quay.io/rhdh/plugin-catalog-index`), all GA
- Overlay E2E improvements: quay (#2873), argocd/topology (#2864), tekton (#2804)

### Decision Records
- Vitest migration: DEFER — stay with Jest (RHIDP-13504)
- Per-support-level Codecov: ENHANCE existing (RHIDP-13511)

## Related Work

### Completed

- **RHIDP-13511**: Per-support-level coverage reporting to Codecov
- **RHIDP-13503**: Align PR coverage upload with baseline workflow
- **RHIDP-13504**: Vitest migration spike (recommendation: stay with Jest)
- **RHIDP-13233**: Layer 1-2 tests for RHDH-owned backend plugins
- **RHIDP-13235**: Layer 3 component tests mirroring UI E2E specs
- **RHIDP-13508**: Cluster-free plugin sanity check for the catalog index (rhdh PR #4967)
- **RHIDP-13512**: Quality expectations for community-supported plugins
- **RHIDP-13513**: Quality expectations for 3rd-party plugins in the Extensions Catalog. The
  story was closed pointing at this document, but the expectations it described were never
  written into it. [Getting a Plugin Listed in the Extensions
  Catalog](#getting-a-plugin-listed-in-the-extensions-catalog) closes that gap.

### In Progress

- **RHIDP-15513**: Orchestrator test coverage expansion
- **RHIDP-13510**: Community plugin load-test suite — the last open story in RHIDP-13497, and
  the only `Required` item in this matrix that is still unimplemented. Work lands in
  `rhdh-plugin-export-overlays` (`smoke-tests-native/`), not in this repo.

### Deferred

- **RHIDP-16009**: Community frontend plugin rendering — blocked on the new frontend system
  (RHIDP-15082, gated by RHIDP-15379)

### Blocked

- **RHIDP-13505**: Enforce PR gating on test failure (blocked by broader team alignment)

## Changelog

- **2026-06-17**: Initial draft based on research and industry best practices
- **2026-07-24**: Updated with verified E2E coverage data, resolved open questions, added governance and recent progress sections
- **2026-08-18**: Added the Layer 4a mechanism note (no Backstage utility boots an instance; `webServer` is the mechanism) after the parent Test Strategy was corrected on the same point; added "Layer 3 and the new frontend system", recording that 16 of 22 plugins with an overlay e2e suite ship an untested NFS surface, with the three mutation-verified assertions that close it; added "Layer 4a already exists, and overlaps Layer 4b", recording 209 cluster-free tests in the plugin repos against 138 overlay cluster tests for the same 10 workspaces, with the caveat that those are tests which exist rather than tests which pass, and leaving the keep-or-remove decision with the plugin owner; noted that the community frontend bundle check now validates module-federation remote shape rather than presence
- **2026-08-04**: Refreshed all support-level counts and coverage baselines against both repos' `main`; reworded the Community load-test requirement from "loads in a default RHDH instance" to "the published artifact installs and boots" (community plugins are no longer in the RHDH image — RHIDP-13262); recorded the RHIDP-13510 scope and its frontend-rendering split into RHIDP-16009
- **2026-08-06**: Added "Getting a Plugin Listed in the Extensions Catalog", stating that the matrix is keyed on the declared support level rather than on plugin ownership, and answering the open question about acceptable evidence from 3rd-party owners with a table of what the overlays pipeline already measures; closed the documentation gap left by RHIDP-13513; corrected the Compliance table's remaining "loads in a default RHDH instance" wording
- **2026-08-21**: Corrected the Layer 4a table — `scorecard` is 16 overlay tests and `orchestrator` 26, not 15 and 24, so the total is 138; stated that both columns count statically declared `test()` blocks and are a floor, because Playwright expands parametrised tests (`--list` reports 19 and 32 for those two); and corrected "the 10 `rhdh-plugins` workspaces" to 10 of the 11, naming `app-defaults` as the one with no upstream lane
- **2026-07-27**: Aligned layer definitions with the Test Strategy Proposal (`startTestBackend` moved from Layer 3 to Layer 2; Layer 4 split into 4a/4b); Jest confirmed as the Layer 1-3 runner per the Vitest spike; added threshold precedence and a proposed Compliance Verification section (pending RACI sign-off)
